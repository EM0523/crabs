# crabs
 Crabs is a kids computer game where a fisherman, called the captain, hunts for a very clever and powerful crab.
 drawLine.m used the x and y coordinate to plot the path of the Captain as he attempts to slay the powerful crab 
 getCapt.m is using captSize to size the captine and then map it using a matrix, you use the Plot command to get the captain plotted on a graph.
 crabs.m plots the captain anywhere on a background image using x, y, captsize, and thetaCapt.
 drawCapt is used to rotate,translate and plot the captians points in the crabs.m function
 drawMap.m is used to conbine the original imige with a crabs text and returns map dimensions.
 getRotation.m is using a matrix to rotate the captain from zero heading to heading thetaCapt
 getTranslation.m is also using a matrix to Shift the captain from (0 , 0) to (xCapt , yCapt)
